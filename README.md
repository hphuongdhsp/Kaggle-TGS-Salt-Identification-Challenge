# Kaggle-TGS-Salt-Identification-Challenge

In this Repository, I story some papers which is useful for my model in this competition, TGS Salt Identification Challenge. 

[1] The Lov√°sz-Softmax loss: A tractable surrogate for the optimization of the intersection-over-union measure in neural networks https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08790.pdf. The implementation: https://github.com/bermanmaxim/LovaszSoftmax

In this paper, the author give the new loss function for the segmentation problem. 

[2] Improving Generalization Performance by Switching from Adam to SGD,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.07628.pdf.
